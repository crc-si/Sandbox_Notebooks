    "## What is Fractional Cover? [[1, 2](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Landsat Fractional Cover product stored in DEA is at 25m x 25m resolution (the same as the Landsat surface reflectance products).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractional Cover represents the proportion of the land surface\n",
    "that is bare (BS), covered by photosynthetic vegetation (PV), or non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fractional Cover product was generated using the spectral unmixing algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) [[2](#References)] which used the spectral signature for each pixel to break it up into three fractions, based on field work that determined the spectral characteristics of these fractions. [[1](#References)]The fractions were retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model.[[1](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The green (PV) fraction includes leaves and grass, the non-photosynthetic fraction (NPV) includes branches, dry grass and dead leaf litter, and the bare soil (BS) fraction includes bare soil or rock.[[1](#References)]\n",

    "## What is WOFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is a web service displaying historical surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia from 1987 to present day. WOfS aims is to allow better understanding of where water is usually present; where it is seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been occasionally observed by satellite. WOfS displays the detected surface water from the Australia-wide Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellite imagery archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each grid cell within the map, WOfS displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  the number of clear satellite observations over the period (1987 to present)\n",
    "-  the number of occasions water was detected\n",
    "-  the percentage of clear observations on which water was detected, and\n",
    "-  the confidence (or probability) that a water observation in this location is correct. This is a percentage, based on a number of factors including the slope of the land and the existence of other corroborative evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "WOFS is used to filter out cells where water is present, and add the landcover of water to the fractional cover analysis.\n",
    "\n",
