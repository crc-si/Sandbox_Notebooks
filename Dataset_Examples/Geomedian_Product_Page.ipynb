    "#### Background: \n",
    "The surface reflectance geometric median (geomedian) is a pixel composite mosaic of a time series of earth observations. Essentially the value of a pixel in a geomedian image is the statistical median of all observations for that pixel over a period of time. An annual geometric median is a high-dimensional median calculated from the reflectance values drawn from a calendar year. The years available are each full calendar year since 1988. The annual geometric medians of surface reflectance measurements are calculated per calendar year, on individual sensors (ie. only Landsat 5 TM or Landsat 7 ETM+ or Landsat 8 OLI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Geomedian data have been generated from yearly stacks of imagery for Landsat5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, they're cloud free and can represent annual change.\n",
