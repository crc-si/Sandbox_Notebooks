    "#### Background: \n",
    "The full SENTINEL-2 mission comprises twin polar-orbiting satellites in the same orbit, phased at 180Â° to each other. The mission carries optical sensors and monitors variability in land surface conditions between the two orbiting satellites there is a return period of 5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Surface Reflectance product has been corrected to account for variations caused by atmospheric properties, sun position and sensor view angle at time of image capture. These corrections have been applied to all satellite imagery in the Sentinel-2 archive. This is undertaken to allow comparison of imagery acquired at different times, by different sensors, in different seasons and in different geographic locations. These products also indicate where the imagery has been affected by cloud or cloud shadow, contains missing data or has been affected in other ways. Near Real-Time capability provides analysis-ready data that is processed on receipt using best-available ancillary information to provide atmospheric corrections.\n",
